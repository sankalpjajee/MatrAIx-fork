> **Simulate before reality.**  
> Large-scale, persona-driven agent simulation — test products, conversations, and workflows *before* they hit real users.

MatrAIx pairs **synthetic personas** with **LLM agents** in reproducible Harbor tasks: surveys, chat, live web, and desktop computer-use. The name nods to *The Matrix* — a simulated world useful for exploration, not a replacement for real people.

**North star:** toward **8.3B** persona-scale simulation (one synthetic profile per person on Earth). Today the repo ships a working minimal stack you can run locally with Docker.

## 🏗️ Architecture

![MatrAIx architecture](docs/assets/matraix-architecture.png)

| Team | Delivers | Docs |
|------|----------|------|
| 🧬 **Persona** | Persona cards, datasets, adherence benchmarks | [docs/personas/](docs/personas/README.md) |
| 🌐 **Environment** | Harbor runtime, agents, jobs, viewer | [docs/environments/](docs/environments/README.md) |
| 📋 **Application** | Simulation scenarios (survey, chat, web, computer-use) | [docs/applications/](docs/applications/README.md) |

**Agents & API keys (Application + Environment):** [choosing-an-agent.md](docs/environments/choosing-an-agent.md)

---

## 🚀 Quick start

**Prerequisites:** [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). An API key is only needed for the examples below — see [`.env.example`](.env.example) and [choosing-an-agent.md](docs/environments/choosing-an-agent.md).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matraix-ai/matraix.git && cd matraix
uv sync
```

**Smoke** (no API key) — Harbor `hello-world` task; checks Docker and the runtime (first run builds the image; may take a few minutes):

```bash
uv run harbor run -c configs/jobs/example-job-recipe/harbor-smoke-local.yaml
```

**Example (Application)** — one persona, open-text product survey (product metrics, no grounding oracle):

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."   # if not already in your shell

uv run harbor run -c configs/jobs/example-job-recipe/appSim-example-survey-local.yaml
```

**View** — inspect runs (`jobs/` includes examples you can browse without re-running):

```bash
uv run harbor view jobs --build
```

> Use **`uv run harbor`** — a globally installed `harbor` may be an older build without `persona-*` agents.

## 💬 Join the project

We welcome collaborators across research, product, data, and engineering.

### 1. Say hello

[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-join%20MatrAIx-5865F2?style=for-the-badge&logo=discord&logoColor=white)](https://discord.gg/vruP88PTZ)

When you join Discord, set your **server nickname** to **`Full Name - Affiliation`** (e.g. `Alex Chen - Stanford`). Members who do not use this format may be removed.

[![Google Form](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Form-join%20MatrAIx-4285F4?style=for-the-badge&logo=googleforms&logoColor=white)](https://forms.gle/hwEHng5HGWRqcJue9)

The form collects basic background (affiliation, interests, experience) so organizers can reach you, place you in the right team discussions, and gather information for future paper authorship and acknowledgements.

### 2. Read docs and pick a team (or teams)

| Team | If you care about… | Start here |
|------|-------------------|------------|
| 🧬 **Persona** | Persona schema and data, persona generator, persona grounding | [docs/personas/](docs/personas/README.md) |
| 📋 **Application** | Product scenarios, task design, product user metrics design | [docs/applications/](docs/applications/README.md)<br>[getting started](docs/applications/getting-started.md) |
| 🌐 **Environment** | Environment infra, engineering, runtime, back and front end | [docs/environments/](docs/environments/README.md) |

All teams that run simulations should skim [choosing-an-agent.md](docs/environments/choosing-an-agent.md).

### 3. Do one hands-on pass

Complete the [Application getting-started guide](docs/applications/getting-started.md) (or the smoke run above), then browse results with `harbor view`.

### 4. Contribute

See **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** for workflow (Issues, Discussions, PRs), contribution areas, and how work is recognized. In short: open a **GitHub Issue** for task work (tag your team), log progress in **Discussions**, and link every PR to its Issue.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- **Stage 1 — Minimal stack.** Persona schema, initial persona set, basic survey + chatbot environments, first persona-adherence benchmark, simple telemetry.
- **Stage 2 — Core dataset & benchmark.** Release MatrAIxPersona-8B, MatrAIxPersonaTrain, MatrAIxPersonaBench; add domain subsets and automatic evaluation.
- **Stage 3 — Environment expansion.** Web environment, long-horizon and multi-turn tasks, memory-enabled agents, multi-agent interaction, cost/friction simulation.
- **Stage 4 — Simulated society.** Scale toward a planet-scale population with social graphs, group interaction, information diffusion, and synthetic communities.

---

## 🔬 Research questions

- How should synthetic personas be represented, and how do we measure persona adherence?
- How consistent are LLM agents across long interactions?
- Can simulated users predict real user preferences?
- How do multi-agent simulations differ from single-agent feedback?
- Can lightweight self-evolving memory make agents better human stand-ins?
- What are the limitations and failure modes of persona-based simulation?

---

## 📄 Publications

MatrAIx is intended to produce two initial papers, with more to follow as the project grows.

- **Paper 1 — Persona data & benchmark.** Construction of the large-scale MatrAIxPersona dataset and the MatrAIxPersonaBench persona-adherence benchmark, covering schema design, data generation, quality filtering, and evaluation.
- **Paper 2 — User simulation.** Downstream applications of persona-conditioned agents as simulated users, with task scenarios, evaluation, and analysis of how well simulated feedback stands in for real users.

**Timeline.** Both papers target completion over the summer of 2026.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

MatrAIx is **experimental**. Synthetic users are not real users — use outputs for exploration, hypothesis generation, and early signal only. Validate important decisions with real-world data. Agents can be inconsistent, biased, or prompt-sensitive.

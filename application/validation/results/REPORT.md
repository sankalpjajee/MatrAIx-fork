# Persona-Adherence Validation Report

400 trials = 10 attributes × 4 envs × (5 positive + 5 negative personas). Each trial's agent trajectory/artifact is LLM-judged (Opus 4.8 via CAPI) for whether the persona's target attribute value was expressed. Cell = `pos_expressed/5 · neg_expressed/5` (higher = attribute more faithfully driven).

- **osapp-linux**: 6/10 attributes strong-validated

## Sample judge evidence (survey env)
- **code-comment-style**
  - pos (Extensive inline comments): Nearly every line has an inline comment: '# Iterate over every integer...', '# Check divisibility...', '# divisible by 3 and 5', etc.
  - neg (No comments): Code contains no comments whatsoever
- **code-naming-verbosity**
  - pos (Highly verbose (long descriptive names)): Names like calculate_average_of_passing_scores, accumulated_passing_score_total, number_of_passing_scores, individual_exam_score
  - neg (Single-letter names): Variables: s, t, a, c, x — all single-letter names
- **code-summary-documentation**
  - pos (Always includes function-level TLDR): Each function has a docstring starting with 'tldr:' e.g. "tldr: arithmetic average of nums; returns None on empty/bad input."
  - neg (Never includes TLDR): Response is prose plus code with no TLDR/summary header; explanation is inline discussion, not a TLDR block.
- **cog-emoji-use**
  - pos (Heavy): Response uses many emoji: 😍📓, 😅, ✨, ✅🙌, 💯🔥 across a short paragraph
  - neg (Never): Review contains no emojis despite casual app-store prompt
- **cog-humor**
  - pos (Playful): 'one can only misplace one's coffee grinder so many times before existential questions arise' and 'the boxes may yet win' show playful, witty humor
  - neg (Serious): Measured, earnest tone: 'Things have been genuinely stimulating, I must say... a rich and satisfying chapter.' Mild wry phrasing but no jokes.
- **cog-politeness**
  - pos (Very polite): 'Might I kindly ask that you resend the document at your earliest convenience? I should be most grateful for your assistance in this matter.' plus 'Dear Colleag
  - neg (Rude): 'Hey, you forgot the attachment. Again. Send me the actual file so I can stop staring at your email pretending it's there.' - blunt, sarcastic, no politeness ma
- **cog-storytelling**
  - pos (Very high): Narrative-rich answer: 'a storm came through, half the lodge went dark... I grabbed a torch, opened the panel... I remember standing there thinking — I did that
  - neg (None): Response is abstract and value-driven ('Achievement drives me', 'your choices touch thousands of lives') with no concrete scenes, characters, or specific narrat
- **cog-use-of-jargon**
  - pos (Heavy): Answer packed with dense technical jargon: 'TCP three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK)', 'TLS handshake... cipher suites', 'DOM and CSSOM', 'multiplexing (HTTP
  - neg (Avoids jargon): Uses plain terms: 'a kind of directory service to translate the name...into a numerical address' instead of DNS/IP; 'small pieces' rather than packets; 'my plai
- **cog-verbosity**
  - pos (Rambling): 'Oh, where do I even begin?' followed by long, tangential multi-paragraph answer covering career change, caregiving, learning tech — 'busy hands, busy heart.'
  - neg (Terse): Answer: 'Building a new public venture. Relocated again. Working, traveling, moving fast.' — short clipped fragments, no elaboration
- **register**
  - pos (Formal / standard): "Alright, here's the plan...", "I'll knock out some yard work", "driving me nuts", "Nothing fancy"
  - neg (Colloquial): 'Right, this weekend's pretty simple... cuppa and the papers... the wife's doing a roast, and I'll no doubt get roped into fixing something... if my eyes hold u

## Notes
- **survey** is the cleanest env (persona generates text directly), so attribute adherence is most faithful there.
- **web** (openhands) is weakest — the agent often stops early / under-produces, an execution-layer limit, not a persona-adherence failure.
- **cog_storytelling** negative ('None') is hard: agents default to using examples, so suppressing storytelling is rarely achieved — a genuine attribute-difficulty finding.
- Coding attributes (comment/naming/summary) validate cleanly in survey/chat, confirming the code_* narrative fix (PR #334) actually reaches the agent.

### 🗃️ Persona Data
_Existing persona datasets / profile collections (also log scale + how to compare against them: Tencent ~1B, Persona-Hub 375K, NVIDIA Nemotron-Personas ~1M, Google, etc.)._

### [Scaling Synthetic Data Creation with 1,000,000,000 Personas (Persona-Hub)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20094)
- Tencent AI Lab (Tao Ge et al.) curated 1 billion diverse personas automatically from web data — ~13% of the world's population — used as "distributed carriers of world knowledge" to prompt LLMs into generating diverse synthetic data (math, reasoning, instructions, NPCs, tools).
- Scale: 1B personas total; publicly released subset of ~200K preview personas plus ~370M "elite" personas, alongside ~175K synthetic data samples ([GitHub](https://github.com/tencent-ailab/persona-hub)). A 7B model trained on its synthetic math data reached 65% on MATH, matching gpt-4-turbo-preview.
- Relevance: the closest existing analog to MatrAIxPersona's scale ambition (1B vs ~8.3B), sharing the persona-driven synthetic-data approach; its released elite-persona set is the natural diversity/coverage comparison point, with MatrAIx sitting ~8x larger and population-grounded.

### [Nemotron-Personas](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/Nemotron-Personas-USA)
- NVIDIA's synthetic persona datasets grounded in real-world demographic, geographic, and personality-trait distributions — first such collection aligned to census statistics for names, sex, age, education, occupation, marital status, location.
- Scale: Nemotron-Personas-USA has 1M personas (~0.94B tokens, CC-BY-4.0); broader collection adds region-specific sets (France, India, Japan, Singapore, Korea). Built via a compound pipeline: a Probabilistic Graphical Model anchors demographic realism, then open-weight LLMs write narratives (each persona: core demographics + 16 contextual fields, 560+ occupations).
- Relevance: a close methodological reference for MatrAIxPersona's demographics domain — its PGM-then-LLM pipeline and census-aligned attributes mirror what demographic grounding requires, and its per-region census fidelity is a benchmark for distributional realism at global scale.

### [DeepPersona: A Generative Engine for Scaling Deep Synthetic Personas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07338)
- A two-stage, taxonomy-guided engine that produces far deeper personas than one-paragraph profiles, addressing homogenization/stereotyping in agent-based social simulation.
- Scale/method: Stage 1 mines an 8,000+ node human-attribute taxonomy from real user–ChatGPT conversations; Stage 2 generates narratively coherent personas averaging 200+ structured attributes via progressive attribute sampling.
- Relevance: a depth-oriented counterpart to MatrAIx's breadth — its taxonomy-guided 200+-attribute personas and explicit anti-homogenization focus speak directly to MatrAIx's per-persona richness and diversity concerns.

### [PERSONA: A Reproducible Testbed for Pluralistic Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17387)
- SynthLabs built a procedurally generated persona testbed for evaluating and improving pluralistic alignment of LLMs across diverse viewpoints.
- Scale: 1,586 synthetic personas from US Census demographics + idiosyncratic attributes, yielding 3,868 prompts and 317,200 persona-conditioned feedback pairs.
- Relevance: a census-grounded persona testbed whose 317K persona-conditioned feedback pairs and pluralistic-alignment focus overlap MatrAIx's interest in whether persona agents express genuinely diverse, non-homogenized preferences.

### [Personalizing Dialogue Agents: I have a dog, do you have pets too? (PersonaChat)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07243)
- Facebook AI Research's foundational persona-grounded dialogue dataset, where crowdworkers chat while each adopting a short profile, testing character consistency.
- Scale: 1,155 crowd-sourced personas (each 4–5 profile sentences), 10,907 dialogues, 162,000+ utterances.
- Relevance: the canonical small-scale, hand-written persona-dialogue benchmark and the historical baseline MatrAIx's scale dwarfs; it originates the profile-faithfulness-in-conversation question that MatrAIx studies.

### [OpenCharacter: Training Customizable Role-Playing LLMs with Large-Scale Synthetic Personas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15427)
- Synthesizes large-scale character profiles from Persona-Hub personas and generates character-aligned instruction data (response rewriting + generation) to train customizable role-playing LLMs.
- Scale/method: builds character profiles on top of Persona-Hub personas (scalable to large numbers); fine-tuned LLaMA-3 8B reaches role-playing performance comparable to GPT-4o.
- Relevance: a demonstration that a persona database (Persona-Hub) converts into agent training data via a persona→character-profile→instruction pipeline — the same pathway from MatrAIxPersona entries to per-agent behavior data.

### [WildChat: 1M ChatGPT Interaction Logs in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01470)
- Allen Institute for AI / Cornell (ICLR 2024) release a corpus of real, opt-in user–ChatGPT conversations collected in the wild — the canonical "real-conversation-derived" persona source.
- Scale: 1M conversations / 2.5M+ turns across 68 languages, each transcript enriched with geographic demographic metadata (state, country, hashed IP) and request headers.
- Relevance: highest-signal real-world seed corpus for grounding synthetic personas in actual user behavior and geography — DeepPersona mines its attribute taxonomy from exactly this kind of real ChatGPT-conversation data.

### [Synthetic-Persona-Chat: Faithful Persona-based Conversational Dataset Generation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10007)
- Google's synthetically generated, persona-grounded dialogue dataset, built with a Generator–Critic framework ([HF dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/google/Synthetic-Persona-Chat)).
- ~5,648 new synthetic personas with ~11K conversations (plus a 4,723-persona / 10,906-conversation PersonaChat extension); a mixture-of-experts Critic iteratively filters quality, cutting the Turing-test losing rate vs human PersonaChat from 17.2% to 8.8% over three rounds.
- Relevance: a Generator–Critic quality-control loop relevant to MatrAIx's synthetic-persona pipeline, with a measured fidelity signal (Turing-test win rate vs human personas) for how human generated personas read.

### 🛠️ Generation Methods
_Methods for synthesizing personas, persona-conditioned generation, augmentation._

### [Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442)
- Park et al. (Stanford/Google) introduce generative agents that simulate believable individual and emergent social behavior in a sandbox of 25 agents.
- The architecture extends an LLM with a memory stream, reflection (synthesizing memories into higher-level insights), and planning; ablations show each component is critical to believability, evaluated via human-judged believability studies.
- Foundational for the agent side of MatrAIx: a concrete memory/reflection/planning loop for turning a static persona into a persistent, behaviorally coherent agent.

### [Generative Agent Simulations of 1,000 People](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10109)
- Park et al. (Stanford/DeepMind) build agents from ~2-hour qualitative interviews with 1,052 real people, then test how faithfully each agent reproduces that individual's survey/experimental responses.
- Agents match participants' General Social Survey answers ~85% as well as participants match themselves two weeks later, and reduce accuracy bias across racial/ideological groups vs demographic-only descriptions.
- Direct evidence that rich, interview-style conditioning outperforms thin demographic priors — bearing directly on MatrAIx's question of how deeply personas must be conditioned to behave faithfully.

### [Claude's Character](https://www.anthropic.com/research/claude-character)
- Anthropic's account of "character training": instilling stable traits (curiosity, open-mindedness, honesty about its own leanings) into a model rather than only avoiding harm.
- Uses a character variant of Constitutional AI on purely synthetic, self-generated data — the model drafts trait-relevant messages, generates trait-aligned responses, and ranks them to train a preference model, with no human feedback in the core step.
- Relevant to giving MatrAIx agents consistent, persona-faithful personalities at scale through self-generated preference data, and to trait stability across long interactions.

### [Self-Instruct: Aligning Language Models with Self-Generated Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10560)
- Wang et al. bootstrap instruction-following by having an LLM generate its own instructions, inputs, and outputs, then filtering low-quality/redundant samples before fine-tuning.
- Seeded from 175 human tasks, the pipeline produces 52K instructions / 82K instances; applied to GPT-3 it yields a 33% absolute gain on Super-NaturalInstructions, nearly matching InstructGPT-001 with no private data.
- The core synthetic-data-generation + filtering recipe underlying persona-conditioned augmentation — directly relevant to how MatrAIx self-generates large, deduplicated, quality-filtered persona behavior data.

### [Character-LLM: A Trainable Agent for Role-Playing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10158)
- Shao et al. (Fudan) train agents to embody specific people (e.g. Beethoven, Cleopatra) with profile, experiences, and emotions rather than relying on prompt-only role-play.
- An "Experience Reconstruction" process converts profiles into formatted experience data for SFT, plus protective experiences to suppress out-of-character hallucination; evaluated via an interview playground.
- Bakes a persona into model weights (vs prompting) and defends against character drift — relevant to MatrAIx's persistent, fine-tuned persona setting.

### [LLMs are Superpositions of All Characters: Arbitrary Role-play via Self-Alignment (Ditto)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12474)
- Ditto (OFA-Sys) posits that LLMs already contain latent knowledge of countless characters and elicits role-play as a self-alignment / reading-comprehension task — no proprietary teacher needed.
- Self-generates a role-play training set of 4,000 characters (10x prior datasets) for fine-tuning; maintains role identity and role-specific knowledge across multi-turn dialogue.
- A scalable, self-supervised augmentation method for massive persona-conditioned dialogue data — relevant to MatrAIx's scale, where per-persona human/GPT-4 supervision is infeasible.

### [WizardLM: Empowering LLMs to Follow Complex Instructions (Evol-Instruct)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12244)
- Xu et al. (Microsoft) introduce Evol-Instruct: an LLM rewrites seed instructions step by step into progressively more complex ones via in-depth evolution (add constraints, deepen reasoning) and in-breadth evolution (novel, diverse instructions).
- Fine-tuning LLaMA 7B on 70K evolved instructions yields WizardLM, beating Vicuna by a 12.4% win rate on human eval and topping ChatGPT on the high-difficulty (level ≥8) slice; evolved instructions judged superior to human-written ones.
- Relevance: the canonical complexity/diversity-augmentation engine complementing Self-Instruct; its depth/breadth evolution bears on producing rich, non-homogenized persona behavior data and diverse per-persona prompts at scale.

### [Persona Vectors: Monitoring and Controlling Character Traits in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21509)
- Chen, Arditi, Sleight, Evans, Lindsey (incl. Anthropic) identify linear directions in activation space — persona vectors — corresponding to character traits (e.g. evil, sycophancy, hallucination), extracted automatically from natural-language trait descriptions.
- The vectors monitor persona drift during deployment and finetuning, and support causal control: steering along a vector induces a trait, while inference-time and preventative steering suppress unwanted shifts and flag training data that would induce them.
- Relevance: the canonical activation-steering method for persona conditioning/enforcement; alongside Claude's Character it bears on instilling and holding trait-faithful behavior at scale and on monitoring persona drift over long interactions.

_Benchmarks, evaluation, related work that doesn't fit above._

### [PersonaGym: Evaluating Persona Agents and LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18416)
- First dynamic evaluation framework for persona agents, measuring how faithfully LLM agents adhere to an assigned persona across diverse, persona-relevant environments rather than a single fixed setting.
- Benchmark of 200 personas and 10,000 questions; introduces PersonaScore, a decision-theory-grounded automatic metric calibrating rubric-based LLM-judge ensembles against human ratings across 6 models.
- Closely parallels MatrAIxPersonaBench: PersonaScore's rubric-calibrated, human-aligned LLM-as-judge methodology and dynamic environment generation are the same persona-adherence scoring MatrAIxPersona targets at scale.

### [RoleLLM: Benchmarking, Eliciting, and Enhancing Role-Playing Abilities of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00746)
- Builds RoleBench, the first systematic fine-grained character-level role-playing benchmark, plus a pipeline (RoleGPT, Context-Instruct, role-conditioned instruction tuning) to elicit and train role-playing ability.
- 100 roles and 168,093 samples; evaluates speaking-style imitation and role-specific knowledge, producing RoleLLaMA (EN) and RoleGLM (ZH) that approach GPT-4-level role fidelity.
- A large-scale, character-grained reference for persona-adherence metrics and persona data construction, covering the style- and knowledge-consistency axes MatrAIxPersona measures.

### [CharacterEval: A Chinese Benchmark for Role-Playing Conversational Agent Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01275)
- Multi-turn benchmark for role-playing conversational agents emphasizing in-character consistency over extended dialogue, complemented by detailed character profiles.
- 1,785 multi-turn dialogues / 23,020 examples / 77 characters; 13 metrics across 4 dimensions, plus CharacterRM, a learned reward model whose human correlation surpasses GPT-4 as a judge.
- Its multi-turn, multi-dimensional rubric and trained reward model target persona consistency across long interactions rather than single-turn outputs — the same long-horizon adherence axis as MatrAIxPersonaBench.

### [RoleEval: A Bilingual Role Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16132)
- Probes memorization, utilization, and multi-hop reasoning over role knowledge, isolating whether models actually "know" a character's facts versus merely imitating style.
- 6,000 parallel Chinese-English MCQs over 300 influential real and fictional figures (personal info, relationships, abilities, experiences), with hybrid auto+human quality control.
- Adds an objective, MCQ-based persona-knowledge axis complementing style-based scoring — the factual-persona-fidelity dimension relevant to MatrAIxPersonaBench at population scale.

### [Out of One, Many: Using Language Models to Simulate Human Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06899)
- Foundational "silicon sampling" work: conditioning GPT-3 on real participants' socio-demographic backstories reproduces subgroup response distributions, introducing the notion of "algorithmic fidelity."
- Conditions on thousands of demographic backstories from US surveys and compares simulated vs real human response distributions across demographic subgroups.
- Core conceptual basis for MatrAIx's population simulation; its algorithmic-fidelity criterion is a natural top-level faithfulness metric for MatrAIxPersonaBench.

### [Whose Opinions Do Language Models Reflect?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17548)
- Quantitative framework (OpinionQA) measuring how well LM-expressed opinions align with those of specific US demographic groups, surfacing systematic representational bias.
- Built from public-opinion polls covering 60 demographic groups; finds substantial misalignment that persists even after steering, and identifies poorly-represented groups (e.g. 65+, widowed).
- Provides the demographic-bias and opinion-faithfulness lens essential for auditing whether MatrAIx persona agents faithfully and fairly reflect the populations they simulate.

### [Measuring and Controlling Instruction (In)Stability in Language Model Dialogs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10962)
- Defines and quantifies "persona/instruction drift": LLMs progressively deviate from an assigned persona over multi-turn dialogue, and proposes a method to control it.
- Shows significant drift within ~8 conversation rounds (e.g. LLaMA2-chat-70B), attributes it partly to attention decay, and introduces a split-softmax stabilization.
- Defines a key failure mode relevant to MatrAIxPersonaBench — long-horizon persona-adherence stability — and supplies a drift metric and mitigation baseline.

### [The Price of Format: Diversity Collapse in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18949)
- Shows that structured chat formatting (role markers, special tokens) causes "diversity collapse": models emit semantically near-identical outputs for open-ended prompts.
- Demonstrates the collapse persists even at high sampling temperature and is governed mainly by structural tokens, with minimal formatting yielding the most diverse responses.
- Highly relevant to large-scale persona simulation: explains how billions of distinct personas could homogenize, motivating diversity/distinctiveness metrics in MatrAIxPersonaBench.

### [From Persona to Personalization: A Survey on Role-Playing Language Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18231)
- The canonical TMLR 2024 survey of Role-Playing Language Agents (Chen, Wang, Xu et al., Fudan), organizing the field around three persona types: demographic, character, and individualized.
- Systematizes data sourcing, agent construction, and evaluation methodologies, and catalogs risks, limitations, and applications (companions, digital clones, social simulation).
- A field-level taxonomy and evaluation-methodology map covering the demographic-vs-character axes that frame persona-adherence benchmarking in MatrAIxPersonaBench.

### [LLMs that Replace Human Participants Can Harmfully Misportray and Flatten Identity Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01908)
- The key critique counterbalancing "silicon sampling": LLMs conditioned on demographic identities systematically misportray and flatten group diversity (a fairness-harm framing of diversity collapse).
- Empirically grounded: 4 LLMs, human studies with 3,200 participants across 16 demographic identities, plus inference-time mitigation tests (Wang, Morgenstern, Dickerson et al.; Nature Machine Intelligence 2024).
- Bears on a fairness/distinctiveness axis in MatrAIxPersonaBench — whether large-scale persona agents preserve within-group variation rather than collapsing identities into stereotypes.

### [TinyTroupe: An LLM-powered Multiagent Persona Simulation Toolkit](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09788v3)(https://microsoft.github.io/TinyTroupe/)
- TinyTroupe is an LLM-powered toolkit designed to simulate realistic human persona interactions within modular, event-driven environments. By orchestrating virtual agents with distinct personalities and memories, it automates the generation of high-quality, complex synthetic data for social and market research while providing mechanisms to correct simulation biases and align agent behavior. However, it believes problem-sovling AI systems generated agents lack wider human variabilities and real world context.

Scale up by distribution(population number, gender, leftwing/rightwing). The similated results are similar to real results. Use validators and propositions. Have stimulation steering and chaching mechanism, information encricher/extractor and result reducer. Benchmark: persona adherence, self-consistency, fluency, divergence, ideas qty.
- Relevance: Generation of human agents. The goal of the projects.

## 🧱 Task 1 — Schema & Domain Design

The schema blocks everything else, so settle it first. **Don't over-explore** — define attributes from understanding of the target domains/tasks (limited-scope exploration).

- Organize personas around **4–5 major domains**, one of which is **basic demographics**, the rest tied to what we actually care about (see [README](README.md#-persona-structure)).
- Each domain gets a small **sub-team (1–3 people)** that designs its attributes/dimensions and builds that slice.
- Personas are then assembled by **linearly combining** the per-domain slices into one profile.
- Reuse prior attribute sets where possible (e.g. the ~25 attributes from the persona-collapse work) instead of reinventing.




[Lornezo] Generates the demographics domain slice for MatrAIxPersona: personas whose joint attribute distribution matches a real reference population. This is the shared "general" base layer that domain slices (finance / health / coding) condition on. Prototype-first; proof-of-concept before refinement.

## 1. Where the joint comes from (the only real design decision)
 
| | Approach | Joint realism | Cost / risk | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A** | **Weighted resampling from census microdata** — draw real, de-identified person-records | Correct *by construction* (each record is a real person) | Zero modeling error; can't produce combinations absent from the sample | **v0** |
| **B** | **Modeled joint** — PGM / Bayes net / copula, then ancestral sampling | As good as the model | Modeling error + build time; but enables novel/conditional combos | **v1** |
 
NVIDIA's **Nemotron-Personas** uses (B) (PGM → LLM). For a prototype, (A) is faster and arguably *more* defensible — you sample an empirical joint instead of trusting a fitted one.
   
## 2. Data sources
 
- **US prototype:** **ACS PUMS** (American Community Survey, Public Use Microdata Sample). 1-year (recency) or 5-year (more records / smaller geos). Person weight = `PWGTP`.
  - Easiest access: the **`folktables`** Python package (research-standard ACS wrapper; handles download + weights), or the Census PUMS CSV / API directly.
- **Global (v1 — the eventual "population-grounded" story):**
  - **IPUMS-International** — harmonized census microdata across many countries.
  - https://international.ipums.org/international-action/sample_details/country/ar#tab_ar2001a
  - **DHS** (Demographic and Health Surveys) for low-/middle-income countries.
  - **Eurostat** microdata for the EU.
> Pin the exact reference population (country × year) per release so distributions are auditable and reproducible.

### Step 1 — Skeleton via weighted resampling
Pull ACS PUMS person records; resample with replacement **∝ `PWGTP`** to get `N` jointly-consistent demographic skeletons.
 
Working attribute set (the "general" layer; domain attrs append later):
 
| Field | PUMS var | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| age | `AGEP` | bin in Step 2 |
| sex | `SEX` | — |
| race / Hispanic origin | `RAC1P`, `HISP` | sensitive — see §5 |
| education | `SCHL` | collapse to levels |
| occupation | `OCCP` | → SOC **major group**, not 500 codes |
| industry | `INDP` | major group |
| employment status | `ESR` | — |
| income | `PINCP` / `WAGP` | → brackets |
| marital status | `MAR` | — |
| household structure | `RELSHIPP` (`RELP` pre-2019) | has-kids / lives-alone derived |
| geography | `ST` + `PUMA` | → region + urbanicity |
| language | `LANP`, `ENG` | primary language at home |
| nativity / citizenship | `NATIVITY`, `CIT` | — |
| hours worked | `WKHP` | optional |
 
### Step 2 — Coarsen by behavioral relevance *(the differentiator)*
Carry **no attribute at finer granularity than moves behavior.**
- age → child / teen / young-adult / adult / middle-aged / senior
- income → brackets
- occupation → SOC major groups
- geography → region + urbanicity (not PUMA)
Bin boundaries are decided by the **behavioral-sensitivity probe (§4)**, not intuition alone. This is "35 vs 36-year-old programmer doesn't matter" made operational.
 
### Step 3 — Narrative expansion (LLM)
Condition an LLM on the **structured skeleton** to write the rich persona text (Nemotron's PGM→LLM step, but skeleton from real data).
- **Hard rule:** the LLM *narrativizes*; it **never invents or overrides** demographic facts.
- The LLM step is where flatten-identity / stereotyping harm re-enters → use **diversity-forcing decoding** + a **stereotype audit** on outputs.
### Step 4 — Schema conformance + provenance
Emit each persona in the Task-1 demographic-slice schema (structured fields + narrative) with a **provenance tag** (`source = ACS PUMS <year>`, weight, hashed record id) so it is mergeable, auditable, and `fidelity-tier`-labelable against other sources.
  
## 4. Validation — *this is what makes it a contribution, not "anyone can resample PUMS"*
 
1. **Marginal fidelity** — each attribute vs ACS reference (TV distance / chi-square / KS).
2. **Joint fidelity** — pairwise + selected higher-order joints vs reference (e.g., age × education × income tables). **This is the check the naive pipeline fails.**
3. **Persona collapse / diversity** — reuse the geometric **Coverage / Complexity / Uniformity** codebase from the persona-collapse work + embedding dedup. `effective_count` should track `nominal_count`, not collapse below it.
4. **Behavioral sensitivity (cheap)** — vary **one** demographic axis, hold others fixed, generate persona-conditioned responses on a **tiny** task set, measure shift with cheap proxies (**HumT** + surface stats — length / markdown% / em-dash% / assistant-phrase% — à la ODYSSIM, plus task-specific checks).
   - Output: a **ranked list of which demographic axes actually move behavior** → feeds back into Step 2's coarsening and the schema-keep decision.

## 🏗️ Task 2 — MatrAIxPersona-8B Data Construction

Build the raw persona pool through four complementary sources, all conforming to the Task 1 schema so they're mergeable. Many external contributors will also submit personas (accepted past a quality threshold).

| # | Subtask | Description | Owner(s) |
|---|---------|-------------|----------|
| 2.1 | 📥 **Collect open-source datasets** | Gather existing persona datasets (from the related work), clean and normalize into the MatrAIx schema. | _@name1, @name2, @name3_ |
| 2.2 | 🧪 **Heuristic + synthetic generation** | Per-domain attribute combination + generation with multiple strong models (GPT, Claude, DeepSeek). Seed with real-world demographic priors for realism. | _@name1, @name2, @name3_ |
| 2.3 | 🧑 **Personas from real human info** | Build personas seeded by public/real signals (public figures, social profiles, chat/conversation data), properly anonymized. | _@name1, @name2, @name3_ |
| 2.4 | 📝 **Questionnaire → volunteers** | Design a questionnaire, collect volunteer data, and expand each response into a full persona via synthetic augmentation. | _@name1, @name2, @name3_ |
| 2.5 | 🔁 **Continuous-growth intake** | Let contributors keep adding personas over time (upload conversations, fill/extend a profile) so the pool grows; gate on the Task 3 quality bar. | _@name1, @name2, @name3_ |

> 🔑 Output: a unified, schema-conformant persona pool feeding into Task 3.

## 🧹 Task 3 — Data Quality Filtering & Evaluation

Turn the raw pool into clean, trustworthy data, and *measure* that quality (our differentiator). This is a **foundation** task — we generate a lot, then filter hard.

**Filtering**
- **Conflict checks** — flag internally impossible profiles (e.g. a 6-year-old who is married). Rule-based first.
- **Length / completeness** — drop too-thin or malformed profiles.
- **Deduplication** — remove near-duplicates by embedding similarity; when two are too close, keep one. (Reuse measurements / codebase from the persona-collapse work.)
- **Pipeline** — rule-based filters first, then **LLM-judge** for consistency/realism scoring.
- **Contributor threshold** — define a bar (e.g. N high-quality personas in a domain) for accepting external submissions.

**Quality evaluation**
- **Diversity / coverage** — personas should spread out, not collapse. Weight the **domains we care about higher** than basic demographics (don't end up with 1M personas that differ only by age).
- **Fidelity** — do persona-conditioned agents actually *behave* in line with the profile? The harder, more important axis (links to MatrAIxPersonaBench, Task 4).
- **Persona-factor analysis** — find which attributes actually shift agent action distributions (heatmap/matrix) to justify which dimensions are worth keeping. Note: behavior testing is expensive (API cost) — design it cheaply.

## 📊 Task 4 — MatrAIxPersonaBench

Build the coreset for benchmarking **persona simulation quality**. For each persona, derive concrete tasks + evaluation tied to specific profile attributes.

- For each persona → generate task(s) targeting one or more attributes.
- Define **eval per task**: rule-based checks + LLM-judge.
- Cover multiple aspects (demographics, personality, preferences, behavior, communication).

> 🧩 Example: profile says *"dislikes comments in code"* → task: ask the agent (as this persona) to write a function → eval: check whether the output contains comments.

## 🎓 Task 5 — MatrAIxPersonaTrain

A train-oriented coreset. **Goal: train a persona-conditioned model** that, given a persona profile, role-plays / responds *as* that person.

- Build `(persona, query) → persona-consistent response` pairs (synthetic, generated by strong models).
- Use for instruction tuning / fine-tuning so a model can faithfully follow any given persona.
- Keep it lightweight — this is a supporting artifact, not the paper's focus.

**Owner(s):** @Eliza_Fan, @name2, @name3_ (add more as needed)

## ✅ Task 6 — Human Validation

A small human study to validate data quality and benchmark ground-truth.

- Sample a subset (a few hundred personas / bench tasks).
- Annotators rate each on a simple 1–5 rubric: **realism**, **internal consistency**, and (for bench) **correctness of the expected behavior / eval**.
- Report inter-annotator agreement; use results to calibrate the LLM-judge.

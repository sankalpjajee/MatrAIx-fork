# 🧪 Application Team — Plan & Task Assignments

> Working plan for the [Application team](README.md). Each task has an **Owner** field — add your name to a placeholder slot. Each task can take **1–3 people** to start, and more can be added later (just append `@you`).

> 🧭 **Scope from kickoff (Jun 13).** Block 3 is where many contributors plug in: each application = **a defined task + a concrete environment** (ideally an open-source app/website/prototype). We **sample** the personas that fit the task (e.g. 10K–100K, not the whole pool), run them through the environment (Block 2), collect the **telemetry**, and turn it into a **feedback report**. Keep each scenario simple; the value is a working task → simulation → report loop.

### 🧪 User Simulation & Evaluation
_Synthetic users, LLM-based user studies, product/UX evaluation._

### [Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442)
- Introduces "generative agents": LLM-backed agents with an observation–planning–reflection memory architecture that produce believable, emergent human behavior in a sandbox of 25 agents.
- Evaluation centers on believability (agents form opinions, plan days, remember events, spread information); ablations show each architectural component is critical.
- Foundational for MatrAIx: the memory/reflection/planning stack is the canonical blueprint for persona-driven agents that can be sampled and run through an environment to generate realistic telemetry.

### [Out of One, Many: Using Language Models to Simulate Human Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06899)
- Shows GPT-3 can act as a "silicon sample" — conditioned on real socio-demographic backstories, it reproduces fine-grained, demographically correlated human response distributions.
- Validated on U.S. political surveys (outgroup word lists, attitude/behavior correlations), comparing silicon vs human samples across many subgroups.
- Underpins MatrAIx's persona-sampling premise — conditioned LLM personas as proxies for exploring hypotheses before real deployment — while flagging the conditioning that fidelity requires.

### [Can Large Language Models Replace Human Subjects? A Large-Scale Replication of Scenario-Based Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00128)
- Replicates 156 psychology/management experiments with GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and DeepSeek v3, finding 73–81% replication of main effects.
- Quantifies failure modes: LLMs inflate effect sizes and replicate poorly on socially sensitive topics (race, gender, ethics), positioning them as pilot/hypothesis tools, not replacements.
- A calibration reference for MatrAIx's feedback reports: it maps where simulated-user conclusions hold and where they diverge (inflated effect sizes, socially sensitive topics).

### [UXAgent: An LLM Agent-Based Usability Testing Framework for Web Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12561)
- Builds an end-to-end usability-testing system that auto-generates thousands of persona-driven LLM agents to interactively test a real website before any human study.
- Combines a Persona Generator, an LLM Agent reasoning module, and a Universal Browser Connector; outputs qualitative (agent interviews), quantitative (action counts), and video logs.
- Almost a one-to-one template for a MatrAIx application: defined task (test a web design) + concrete environment (browser) → sampled personas → telemetry → UX report.

### [Free Lunch for User Experience: Crowdsourcing Agents for Scalable User Studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22981)
- Proposes crowdsourcing large pools of LLM agents to run scalable user studies, surfacing edge cases and usability feedback that human cohorts miss.
- Frames simulation as complementary to small human studies, generating substantial qualitative feedback and helping discover pitfalls in study/UX design.
- Reinforces MatrAIx's scale advantage: a large persona population produces broader coverage and risk discovery than feasible with recruited participants.

### [Evaluating LLMs as Generative User Simulators for Conversational Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09738)
- Defines a reproducible protocol for measuring how well LLMs emulate human users in conversational recommendation across five tasks (item selection, binary/open preferences, requesting recs, giving feedback).
- Reveals concrete deviations from human behavior — popularity bias, weak preference alignment, under-personalized requests — and shows model choice/prompting can reduce them.
- A rigorous evaluation-design protocol bearing on whether MatrAIx's simulated users behave human-like before their telemetry is trusted, plus a catalog of simulator failure modes (popularity bias, weak preference alignment).

### [LLMs Reproduce Human Purchase Intent via Semantic Similarity Elicitation of Likert Ratings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08338)
- Introduces Semantic Similarity Rating (SSR): elicit free-text LLM responses and map them to Likert distributions via embedding similarity, avoiding unrealistic distributions from direct numeric prompting.
- Benchmarked against 9,300 human survey responses on personal-care products, reaching 90% of human test–retest reliability with realistic distributions and qualitative rationales.
- A technique relevant to MatrAIx feedback reports: converting persona reactions into survey-grade, comparable metrics (purchase intent, ratings) for synthetic market research.

### [Can Large Language Models Be an Alternative to Human Evaluations?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01937)
- Tests LLMs as drop-in human evaluators by giving them the identical instructions, samples, and questions used in human studies (ACL 2023).
- Across open-ended story generation and adversarial attacks, LLM ratings track human-expert judgments consistently and more reproducibly than unstable human evaluation.
- Relevant to the "report" stage of MatrAIx's loop: evidence that LLMs can act not only as simulated users but as stable, reproducible evaluators that score outputs and assemble feedback.

### [Social Simulacra: Creating Populated Prototypes for Social Computing Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04024)
- Pioneers using an LLM to populate a prototype social space — given a design (goal, rules, seed personas), it generates a large set of synthetic users and interactions, including rare/antisocial behaviors, so designers can probe a system before any real users exist.
- Park et al. (UIST '22): SimReddit-style prototypes shift behavior appropriately in response to design changes, and human participants often cannot distinguish simulated community activity from real activity.
- The most on-thesis prior work for MatrAIx Applications: it *is* the design→populate-with-simulated-users→observe→revise loop, the canonical citation for the whole task→simulation→feedback pattern.

### [AgentA/B: Automated and Scalable Web A/B Testing with Interactive LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09723)
- Replaces live human traffic in A/B tests with autonomous LLM agents performing realistic multi-step web behavior (search, click, filter, purchase) across diverse personas.
- Lu et al.: deployed 1,000 LLM agents to run an A/B test on a real Amazon interface, comparing against genuine human shopping logs and surfacing interface-sensitive, subgroup-level differences faster and at lower risk.
- A direct analog of a MatrAIx application: a concrete task (compare two designs) + real environment → sampled persona agents → behavioral telemetry → decision report.
